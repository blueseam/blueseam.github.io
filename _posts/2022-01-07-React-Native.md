# React Native Notes

1. Install Homebrew

Homebrew installs the stuff you need that Apple(or Linux) didn't

```

blueseam@MacBookPro ~ % brew update
```

2. Install nodejs(mpm)

```
blueseam@MacBookPro ~ % brew install node

blueseam@MacBookPro ~ % node -v
v17.3.0

blueseam@MacBookPro ~ % npm -v

```

3. Install Expo CLI(Developer Tools)

Expo is a set of tools built around React Native

```
blueseam@MacBookPro ~ % npm install -g expo-cli
